The protesters, who had been camping out for two months, were waiting to be removed by the police.

The protesters chanted slogans against excessive corporate greed and power, served food, and handed out water. Police looked on calmly, and Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said that the police would prefer to work with the protesters towards a resolution rather than confrontation. The city needs to erect fencing for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink. Over the last few days, the protesters had begun to dismantle their tents, and by 7:15 p.m., roughly a third of the original 300 tents were gone. \n\nIn Los Angeles, police in riot gear closed in on anti-Wall Street activists who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall. Police managed to reopen blocked streets for morning rush-hour commuters after a tense standoff with protesters who had taken over a downtown intersection. Four demonstrators were arrested during the brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly, before police ultimately pulled back from City Hall park. Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with a 2-month-old national Occupy Wall Street movement protesting economic inequality and excesses of the US financial system. Villaraigosa eventually gave protesters until just after midnight to remove their tents and leave or face a forcible removal, setting the stage for the latest showdown between leaders of a major US city and the Occupy movement. But about two hours after the eviction deadline had passed, police commanders said they would permit the Occupy LA encampment to stay until at least daybreak.

The jury cleared Kleiner Perkins of all claims that it had unfairly terminated Pao's career due to her gender. The firm has offered to waive its legal costs if Pao chooses not to appeal the decision.

However, in 2013, a prosecutor found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly found guilty. Judge William Brady threw out the conviction after the prosecutor's finding. McCullough was freed shortly after the hearing and was whisked away in a car driven by a family member. Maria's murder went unsolved for half a century. Then detectives pursued a tip, and a man was brought to trial and convicted in the 1957 murder of the 7-year-old in Sycamore, Illinois. Now that man is free. Ann O'Neill's 2013 series on the case, \"Taken,\" raised questions about whether the trial was unfairly one-sided. Charles Ridulph, the older brother of the victim, frowned and bowed his head. More than 58 years ago, he helped search for Maria after she vanished from a street corner near their home while playing in the snow with a friend.

{"pred": " In July 2018, a 3-year-old boy named Carter Roberts from Chesterfield, Virginia, was diagnosed with a mysterious, polio-like illness called acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Carter's mother, Robin Roberts, noticed that he was vomiting and had a slight fever, but when she found him collapsed on the floor, she realized something was seriously wrong. Carter lost control of his right arm and then his legs and other muscles within a few days. He was diagnosed with AFM, which has been surging this year, with 32 new cases confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as of July. This is a significant increase compared to the seven cases confirmed by that month last year. The CDC began tracking AFM in 2014, when 121 cases were confirmed, and most cases occur between August and December, with a peak in October. However, the rising number of cases through July could foretell a repeat of 2014. The cause of AFM remains unknown, and no treatment other than physical therapy has yet been shown to markedly improve outcomes. Some doctors have reported that treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or Prozac might help, but more research is needed. The condition is rare, affecting only a small percentage of children, but it can cause severe paralysis. In 2014, most children who developed AFM recovered partially, but only three of them recovered fully. The CDC is looking into the trend carefully and encouraging doctors to report cases in a timely fashion. In another case, a 5-year-old girl named McKenzie Anderson was diagnosed with AFM in 2012, and her family had to undergo months of rehabilitation to help her recover. She is now doing much better, but still has weakness on the right side of her body. The CDC is collaborating with partners nationally to investigate the reported cases, risk factors, and possible etiologies of this condition. Being up to date on all recommended vaccinations is essential to prevent severe diseases, including poliomyelitis, which can present with acute flaccid paralysis. General hygiene measures, such as frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick persons, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, can also help prevent viral infections. If a child appears to have a sudden onset of weakness in arms or legs, caregivers should contact a healthcare provider to have the child assessed for possible neurologic illness.

The investigation, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, involved analyzing the bloodstain patterns on the cloth and comparing them to those that would be expected from a person who had been crucified or hung on a cross. The researchers concluded that the linen appears to have been patched with bloodstains from a standing model, rather than a crucified man or a facedown corpse. This suggests that the shroud may have been a medieval fraud. The researchers used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, and found that the bloodstains were inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back. If it were a death shroud of a bleeding, executed person, hung on a cross, or pulled down from one for burial, the researchers said, \"the bloodstains shouldn't be so inconsistent.\" The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a genuine religious relic, and it has been analyzed and scrutinized for many years. More than 2 million people saw the Shroud of Turin in 2015, when it was displayed in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The Malian army is falling apart, and the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE), which overthrew President Amadou Toumani Touré, has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. The West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, and they have reacted with commendable promptness.

The sanctions imposed by the West African nations have caused long lines at petrol stations in the capital, Bamako, in response to the embargo. The country will struggle to survive an economic blockade, and the Tuareg rebels have taken advantage of the political situation and made rapid advances in the past few days, controlling a third of the West African country, including the key northern towns of Gao, Kidal, and Timbuktu.

The rebels have ransacked bars serving alcohol and banned Western music on local airwaves. In Timbuktu, people told the BBC that Ansar Dine members are going from door-to-door telling occupants that they now have to live by the principles of Islamic law.

It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas. The country is suspected of focusing on V-type chemical agents, which are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods.\n\n2. Kim Jong Nam's Death: Kim Jong Nam, the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was killed by a highly toxic nerve agent, VX, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. Malaysian toxicology reports indicate that the presence of the nerve agent was detected in swabs taken from Kim's eyes and face. The two women who interacted with Kim before his death immediately went to wash their hands, showing awareness of handling a toxin. The case has led to a diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea, with North Korea denying responsibility and accusing Malaysia of having sinister purposes.\n\n3. VX Nerve Agent: VX is the most potent of the known chemical warfare agents, a clear, amber-colored, oily liquid that is tasteless and odorless. It works by penetrating the skin and disrupting the transmission of nerve impulses, causing death within minutes. Lower doses can cause symptoms like eye pain, blurred vision, drowsiness, and vomiting. The agent can be disseminated in a spray or vapor when used as a chemical weapon, or it can contaminate water, food, and agricultural products. Clothing can carry VX for about 30 minutes after contact with the vapor, exposing others to the risk of intoxication. Malaysia's police chief Khalid Abu Bakar confirmed that VX nerve agent was used in the attack on Kim Jong Nam, raising concerns about public safety in the airport and the possibility of contamination spreading beyond the airport premises.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic period, is a bird-like carnivore that was about the size of a crow. The most remarkable feature of Caihong juji is its iridescent feathers, which shimmered and shifted in the light like those of a hummingbird. The feathers were preserved in exceptional detail, allowing scientists to determine that they were made up of long, flat melanosomes that split light like a prism, creating a metallic sheen that changed color with the viewing angle. The discovery suggests that iridescent feathers may have evolved earlier than previously thought, and that they may have been used for social or sexual signaling in dinosaurs. Caihong juji also had a bird-like body, including the necessary feathers for flight, but it had a crested head that resembled that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur may have glided from tree to tree, preying on small mammals and lizards.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": " Seattle, Washington, implemented a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages on January 1, 2018, aiming to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community college funding, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, the tax has faced criticism for its unintended consequences. In Cook County, Illinois, a similar soda tax was repealed within two months due to public outcry. The tax has driven sales outside city limits, causing revenue loss for Seattle. Business managers and customers have responded by directing purchases to areas outside the tax zone, with retailers like Costco posting signs to guide shoppers. The tax disproportionately affects low-income families and has not led to healthier behaviors among consumers. Critics argue that the tax is regressive and job-killing, uniting diverse coalitions against it. The tax has also led to lawsuits and administrative challenges, with some retailers facing legal action for misapplying the tax. Despite the controversy, Seattle officials believe the tax will generate $15 million annually, partly to fund a program providing healthy meals for low-income families. The tax has sparked debate on its effectiveness in promoting health improvements versus its potential negative impacts on local businesses and consumer behavior. The situation highlights the complexities of implementing such policies and the importance of considering unintended consequences.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

House Speaker John Boehner has proposed a plan to fund agencies through December 15th, including conditions related to the Affordable Care Act, such as delaying its implementation for a year and repealing the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats and President Obama have stated they will reject any changes to the healthcare law. Boehner argues that the proposal represents a compromise between repealing the law entirely and making no changes. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, leaving little time to resolve the issue before the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a shutdown. Democrats plan to vote down any bill that includes anti-Obamacare provisions, potentially leading to a partial government shutdown for the first time since the Clinton era. The shutdown could result in a loss of $200 million per day for the Washington region, affecting over 700,000 jobs and causing disruptions to federal services such as trash pickup, libraries, and child care. The region's economy, already weakened by sequestration cuts, could suffer further damage. The ripple effects of a shutdown could impact state and local governments, affecting critical services such as Meals on Wheels, police officers, and emergency preparedness training. The Congressional Research Service has warned that previous shutdowns have caused disruptions to national parks, passport and visa applications, clinical trials, and bankruptcy and child support cases.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The probe will be launched in summer 2018 and will rely on advanced engineering to withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit while protecting the science instruments at room temperature. The spacecraft will make 24 orbits around the sun, passing within 9 solar radii of the sun's surface, seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. The mission aims to trace the energy behind solar wind, understand the heating of the solar corona, and determine what accelerates the solar wind. The findings will help answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The Parker Solar Probe will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the blazing sun. The arrays will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun, keeping it at a safe temperature and also powering it with the sun. The spacecraft will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion or the closest point to the sun. The spacecraft will then repeat that flyby of the perihelion routine 23 more times over its lifetime until 2025. The 20-day launch window opens July 31, 2018. After testing the assembly, the spacecraft will arrive at NASA's Kennedy Space Center to prep for launch. The Parker Solar Probe is the first time a spacecraft will be named for a living person, and it is a testament to the importance of Parker's body of work in founding a new field of science that inspired my own research and many important science questions NASA continues to study and further understand every day.

Chandrasekhar Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago, also attended NASA's announcement and expressed excitement about seeing the science form the mission going to a region of space never before explored. He said he is sure that there will be some surprises, as there always are.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The company only recently disclosed the breach, stating that customer payment card information was stolen, but assured that Social Security numbers and birth dates were not compromised. Neiman Marcus faced criticism for not disclosing the breach sooner, especially considering the timing of the holiday season. \n\nThe second breach was at Target, which experienced a widespread attack resulting in the theft of 40 million credit and debit card numbers, along with encrypted PINs for debit cards. Additionally, personal information belonging to 70 million people was also stolen. Target informed its customers about the attack within a few days of learning about it, which led to a significant impact on sales during the holiday rush. \n\nA third breach was reported at Neiman Marcus, which was found to have lasted significantly longer than the Target breach. The company only publicly acknowledged the data breach after facing inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security. Neiman Marcus has faced criticism for not disclosing the breach sooner, particularly considering the timing of the holiday season. \n\nA report from a computer firm hired to investigate the Target breach provided new insights into the holiday hacking.

Mohawk, who was 13 years old, had recently been involved in territorial fights and had strayed from the Nairobi National Park. The lion had become a popular tourist attraction due to its distinctive Mohawk-style mane. Wildlife officials had planned to capture the lion, but the animal became too agitated by the noise of a gathering crowd and had to be killed. The circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. In South Africa, another lion named Sylvester had escaped from Karoo National Park and was being considered for relocation or killing if it caused \"massive\" damage or was a direct threat to humans. The two cases of African lions on the loose highlight the difficult balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, a loss of habitat, and growing conflict with livestock herders. The circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources, and whether the area where a lion is roaming is densely populated. In Kenya, the population around the park has grown more than tenfold since it was established in 1946, leading to conflicts between lions and humans. In South Africa, the government started building a highway through a section of the park, agitating the animals with constant noise.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

However, a healthy lifestyle can significantly impact the prevention and treatment of CAD. \n\nIn conclusion, the three news passages highlight the potential dangers of yo-yo dieting for individuals with coronary artery disease. The study conducted by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center found that weight fluctuations over time were associated with a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death among people with coronary heart disease. The findings suggest that maintaining a stable weight is crucial for individuals with pre-existing heart disease, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop strategies to help Americans maintain a healthy weight.", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another. And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

The issue didn't pose an immediate threat to the crew's safety, but it necessitated a reduction in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. The crew was never in any danger, according to NASA spokesman Josh Byerly. The problem involved one of the ISS's two external cooling loops, Loop-A, which shut down due to reaching a pre-set temperature limit. This forced NASA to redirect coolant to Loop-B, leading to a prioritization of life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the preservation of scientific samples in freezers. Some non-critical systems were turned off in the ISS's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab. Engineers suspect a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant as the cause of the problem. Mission managers are assessing whether a software fix can resolve the issue or if a spacewalk will be necessary. The crew worked to maintain the freezers' functionality. The crew currently consists of two Americans, three Russians, and a Japanese astronaut. The ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000, with plans to maintain it through 2020, though discussions about extending its operational life are ongoing.

{"pred": " \n\nThe news articles discuss the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger individuals, challenging traditional perceptions that this disease predominantly affects older men. A study by the University of Michigan analyzed national data and revealed that approximately one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This finding suggests that the current guidelines recommending screening at age 50 might not adequately address the growing number of younger patients being diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease.\n\nYounger patients are more likely to present with regional or distant malignancies, indicating that they may not exhibit typical symptoms, leading to delayed diagnosis. The study highlights that younger patients with metastatic colorectal cancer are more likely to undergo surgery and receive radiation therapy compared to older patients. Despite having more advanced disease at diagnosis, younger patients tend to experience slightly longer periods without cancer recurrence, possibly due to more aggressive treatment approaches.\n\nThe researchers emphasize the importance of improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults, suggesting that maintaining the age 50 recommendation for screening might result in nearly 15% of patients being diagnosed too late. This finding contrasts with breast cancer screening recommendations, which start at age 40 for certain high-risk individuals. The study underscores the need for increased awareness among healthcare professionals regarding the signs of colorectal cancer in younger patients and the potential benefits of earlier screening for those at higher risk based on family history or other risk factors.\n\nHowever, the study's limitations include the lack of data on family history and other risk factors for colorectal cancer, as well as the possibility of selection bias influencing treatment choices and overall survival outcomes. The authors caution against hastily altering screening guidelines without further research to determine whether doing so would ultimately prevent more cancer deaths.\n\nIn conclusion, the rising incidence of colorectal cancer among younger individuals challenges existing screening guidelines and highlights the need for improved risk assessment and awareness among healthcare providers. Further research is necessary to explore the most effective strategies for detecting and treating colorectal cancer in this population, potentially leading to earlier detection and improved outcomes. The medical community must adapt its approach to better serve the growing number of younger colorectal cancer survivors, ensuring they receive appropriate long-term support to manage the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

The discovery was made at a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, which was initially uncovered when an archaeologist needed to use the restroom. The site contained sophisticated tools, bone fragments from the largest ever marsupial, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a marsupial measuring 2m in height and weighing more than 2,500kg. The site also contained the earliest-known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia around 49,000-46,000 years ago. The discovery pushes back the dates on the development of technologies such as bone needles (40,000-38,000 years ago), wood-handled stone tools (at least 24,000 years ago) and gypsum use (40,000-33,000 years ago). The site also provided reliably dated evidence of hafted axe technology about 38,000 years ago. The discovery challenges the notion that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world. The site is located more than 2,000 km from the early settlement of Lake Mungo in southeastern New South Wales, making it a much more difficult trek, and suggests that early humans were actually interacting with Australia’s legendary megafauna. The find is controversial, but the methodology of the study is considered to be as good as it gets, and the discovery is seen as a significant milestone in the debate over whether humans or climate change drove the extinction of megafauna. The site is located on the property where Warratyi was located when he was a teenager, and the elders he had worked with had told him their people had lived in the area and had pointed out a lot of the shelters.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

{"pred": " \n\nThe discovery of Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment chunks in southern Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin suggests that toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives occurred approximately 320,000 years ago. This implies that dramatic shifts in the East African climate may have driven these behavioral changes in members of the Homo genus, which amplified in H. sapiens. The oldest excavated Middle Stone Age tools are the oldest of their kind, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. These tools, spearpoints and other small implements struck from prepared chunks of stone, are the oldest of their kind, with researchers previously estimating that such tools date back to no earlier than 280,000 to possibly 300,000 years ago. The downsizing of more primitive, handheld cutting stones made of local rock occurred from 615,000 to 499,000 years ago, a stretch characterized by frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions. The Olorgesailie Basin, which comprised a series of floodplains around 800,000 years ago, developed into a vast arid grassland with massive turnover of prey mammal species due to climate change. This would have made life difficult for early humans in the region by making food sources unpredictable. The crux of these papers is that hominin populations did not disappear - so at least some of them must have adapted technologically and culturally, with the environment driving greater mobility, information gathering and sharing, and innovation. The team found distinct differences in the forms of stone tools compared to older deposits in the area - suggesting technological innovation had taken place. The transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent. The appearance of the earliest Middle Stone Age technology is not necessarily a cultural marker linked to the evolution and appearance of our own species, as the association between Early and Middle Stone Age and pre- and fully-modern human fossils remains complex and confusing across Africa. However, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin suggest that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things at this critical time period, requiring an understanding of space and time, bringing materials over great distances, and passing on technological skills through successive generations. This suggests expanded social networks, transmission of information, and technological innovation. The \"human revolution\" that made us", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

{"pred": " A nine-year-old boy named Kieran, born without fully formed ears, underwent a groundbreaking surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London. The operation involved transplanting cartilage from his ribs to create a pair of ears, primarily for cosmetic purposes. Kieran, who was born deaf and with a rare condition called bilateral microtia, had previously undergone multiple surgeries and wore a hearing aid, allowing him to hear to some extent. The procedure was led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, who used an outline of Kieran's mother's ears as a reference to ensure the new ears matched her appearance closely. The surgery took six hours and involved carving and shaping the rib cartilage into ear frameworks, which were then grafted onto Kieran's head under pockets of skin. A vacuum was used to shape the skin to the contours of the new ears. Kieran's father, David Sorkin, expressed relief and joy over the successful outcome, stating that it would boost his son's confidence and improve his overall quality of life. Kieran, who had longed for the operation, was delighted with the results, expressing a desire to wear sunglasses and earphones. The surgery brought significant psychological benefits, as it allowed Kieran to feel more accepted and confident among his peers. The operation was considered a major milestone, with Great Ormond Street Hospital performing approximately 40 of these procedures annually. However, most of these were for patients with only one missing ear. The surgery was not intended to improve hearing, as Kieran already had a hearing aid, but it significantly enhanced his self-esteem and social integration. The procedure was not without challenges, as Kieran experienced pain due to the operation on his ribs, particularly when laughing. Nevertheless, he was thrilled with the outcome and eagerly awaited a follow-up operation in six months to further refine the appearance of his ears. The success of this surgery highlights the potential for advancements in reconstructive surgery, particularly in the field of tissue engineering. Researchers at the University College London Institute for Child Health are exploring the possibility of creating new ear frameworks and other skeletal structures from a child's own stem cells, potentially offering a less invasive alternative to the current rib cartilage harvesting process. While this technology is still in its early stages, it holds promise for improving the lives of children born with similar conditions in the future. Overall, Kieran's story represents a triumph of medical innovation and the transformative impact it can have on a child's life, providing hope for others facing similar challenges.", "answers": ["An operation in London has given 9-year-old Kieran Sorkin a pair of ears—made from his ribs, no less.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

The law also allows for the legal use of marijuana for religious purposes by Rastafarians, who can now use it for the first time on the island where the spiritual movement was founded. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad will be able to apply for permits to legally purchase small amounts of \"ganja\" in Jamaica. However, the government has made it clear that the passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing, or exporting of ganja, and the security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with their international treaty obligations. This historic amendment comes after decades of debate and discussion about the culturally entrenched drug in Jamaica, and it adds to the international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. The new law also aims to correct decades of criminalizing tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a little \"spliff,\" and it begins to correct the victimization of Rastafarian brethren.

EIA's independent investigations have concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood. Johnson argues that Gibson understood the risks involved and chose to source illegally from Madagascar despite knowing the ban on exports of ebony and rosewood.\n\nGibson vehemently denies these allegations, asserting that all its purchases from Madagascar comply with both U.S. and Malagasy laws. The company claims to have provided documents supporting this claim and states that it ceased importing wood from Madagascar in 2009. \n\nChris Martin, Chairman and CEO of the C.F.

This ocean, which was a mile deep in some areas, contained 20 million cubic kilometers of water, comparable to the size of the Arctic Ocean. The discovery was made by analyzing infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere, which showed that water near the ice caps was enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars had lost a vast amount of water in the past.\n\nThe researchers estimate that Mars once had enough water to create a global ocean with a depth of 137 meters, although it likely formed a deeper ocean in the northern plains. This ocean persisted for millions of years until the Martian atmosphere thinned, causing more water to evaporate into space, and the planet lost its insulation, leading to the eventual freezing of the remaining water. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked in the polar caps.\n\nThis finding challenges previous beliefs that Mars had sporadic water presence and suggests that the planet was warmer and wetter for a longer period than previously thought. The increased understanding of Mars' ancient water cycle and its potential for supporting life has implications for future missions, such as the upcoming Exomars rover, which aims to search for chemical signatures of life on the planet.\n\nThe discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars raises the possibility that the planet may have been habitable in the distant past, potentially allowing for the emergence of life.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states.

Nestlé had been fighting for over a decade to trademark the four-fingered wafer shape of the popular snack, which had previously been challenged by rival Cadbury. The ECJ's decision means that the shape of the KitKat bar will no longer be protected by trademark in Europe, potentially allowing for own-brand imitations and competitors like Norway's Kvikk Lunsj to enter the market.

The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and therefore would have co-occurred with open-mouthed vocalizations. The study also indicates that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and may have been used during mating displays.

The study, which covered 188 countries from 1980 to 2013, found that obesity rates have risen significantly in both rich and poor nations, with the number of overweight and obese people increasing from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013. The US leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the population being obese, but obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with rates rising in both developed and developing countries. The study found that obesity rates are particularly high in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands. The researchers noted that obesity is a complex problem fueled by the availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, salty, high-calorie \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles. They also warned that obesity is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications of weight kill about 3.4 million adults annually. The study found that not one country has succeeded in cutting its obesity rate during the 33 years studied, and that two-thirds of the obese population resides in developing countries. The researchers called for urgent action to address the obesity crisis, which they said is a \"main risk factor for morbidity and mortality.\"", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

{"pred": " \n\nIn Egypt, the final round of parliamentary elections took place amidst the ongoing trial of former President Hosni Mubarak. Islamist groups, particularly the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, are expected to consolidate their gains, with the party leading ahead of the more conservative Nour party, which represents Salafi Muslims. The election and Mubarak's trial, which resumed after a two-month break, are occurring amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, who claim they will not relinquish power until the end of June. Economic growth has slowed due to the unrest, deterring tourists and investors, with foreign currency reserves declining by 44% to $20.2 billion in the first 11 months of 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood aims to form a coalition or unity government to avoid alienating liberals or Westerners who might fear an Islamist takeover. Winning a clear majority would enable the Brotherhood's party to govern without forming a coalition, reducing the power of ultra-conservative Islamists and liberal parties. The new parliament is expected to confront the military rulers, as Brotherhood leaders anticipate the parliament taking authority over hiring and firing a prime minister to run the interim government. The military rulers, however, intend to retain that authority and allocate minimal power to the parliament. The trial of Mubarak and his sons, Alaa and Gamal, continues, with the prosecution accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last 10 years of his rule to ensuring his son would succeed him. Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the crackdown on the popular uprising that forced him out of office on February 11, 2011. The two sons face corruption charges in the same case. The trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, including a demand by lawyers representing the victims that the presiding judge be removed. Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted of complicity in the killing of protesters. The military generals who succeeded Mubarak are beholden to the former leader for their ascent through the military ranks, and many within the protest movement believe Mubarak and his sons were only arrested and put on trial under pressure from a series of massive protests demanding accountability.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.
